In last article [Functional Programming Part 1 - Concept](/blog/functional-programming-part-1-concept), we've talked about the basic concept of Functional Programming. Let's review it quickly:

When we talk about Functional Programming, there're several key concepts we need to understand:

1. Side effects: in short, side effects refer to any behavior a function performs beyond returning a value, it's influenced
   by time or number of execution or both, such as input/output operations, network requests, or database interactions.
2. Pure functions: a pure function always produces the same output when given the same input, and we called this "Mathematical functions".

In Chapter 2, author introduces the 2 key methods to apply FP in real world:

1. identify actions, calculations, and data.
2. First class functions.

## Glance of stratified design

**Stratified design** is a software design "principle" that focused on creating **strata** or
levels of abstraction where each layer builds upon the previous one, key points:

1. Each layer uses operations and abstractions form the layers below it.
2. Each layer has a clear and consistent level of abstraction.
3. Changes in one layer ideally should not require changes in other layers.
4. Functions in the same layer should operate at similar abstraction levels.

Author uses the example of a pizza restaurant to illustrate the concept of stratified design.

- Business Layer: the highest layer, it's responsible for the business logic.
- Domain Layer: the middle layer, it's responsible for the domain logic, for example, the pizza receipt.
- Tech stack: the lowest layer, it's responsible for basic data types and structures.

And the red arrows show the each layer depends on the layer below it.
