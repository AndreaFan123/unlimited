## When a Company’s Culture Is Shaped by Faith
In Taiwan’s job market, especially outside of multinational companies, there often seems to be a lack of sensitivity toward religion, ethnicity, and political diversity. Most people don’t talk about these issues openly—until something happens that forces the conversation. This creates a workplace culture shaped by reading the room and avoiding discomfort, rather than encouraging honest dialogue.

Recently, I joined a company whose organizational DNA is deeply rooted in faith. While I respect that origin, I began to feel a growing disconnect—especially when the company didn’t make a proactive effort to understand those of us who don’t share that belief.
When faith-based rituals, like prayer sessions or worship activities, are integrated into work hours and participation is expected—but not explicitly required—it creates a subtle but powerful pressure. Being told “you don’t have to join” doesn’t mean much when everyone else does and silence is the only socially acceptable response.

## When Faith Becomes a Mask for Structural Gaps
Faith can be a source of love, compassion, and community. 
But when it becomes part of a company’s structure—without clear boundaries or critical reflection—it can unintentionally mask real organizational flaws.

In environments like this, faith-driven values often get embedded into decisions or policies without being questioned. These decisions may be well-intentioned, but they can overlook practical realities faced by employees.
For example: team gatherings labeled as work yet framed as voluntary, questioning why some departments don't attend worship sessions, or mandatory offsite events with unclear expectations about work responsibilities.
These are not isolated issues—they point to a pattern where faith is used to reinforce rules rather than invite openness.

When spiritual ideals are treated as sacred rules that can't be questioned, they risk becoming tools of exclusion rather than inclusion.

## What True Inclusion Looks Like
Real inclusion is not about saying “we welcome everyone,” but about building systems that are flexible and thoughtful enough to accommodate real differences.

It’s easy to say diversity is embraced. But unless those words are reflected in the company’s daily operations and culture, they can feel disingenuous.
You may not be explicitly forbidden from voicing discomfort—but the moment you do, you risk becoming the “difficult one” or “the outsider.”

I believe every workplace culture deserves respect. But that respect should go both ways. Organizations must consciously design space for different voices—and protect people’s right to opt out without penalty.

Not forcing participation isn’t the same as creating real freedom.
Surface-level harmony doesn’t always mean authentic respect.

I’m still learning how to stay open to worldviews different from mine. But I’ve also learned this: when a place makes you feel quietly alienated or misaligned, choosing to leave isn’t about being narrow-minded—it’s about honoring your own values and boundaries.
