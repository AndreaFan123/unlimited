Recently, due to work requirements, I've been delving into backend technologies, including creating APIs and adding new database fields for new features. Over the next few articles, I will explore database-related knowledge through practical operations to learn the basic concepts of databases. This is the first article, so we will focus on a basic introduction to databases.

## Two Main Categories of Databases

Databases can be divided into two main categories:

1. Relational Databases (SQL Databases)
2. Non-relational Databases (NoSQL Databases)

### Relational Databases (SQL Databases)

- Data is presented in tables, which consist of columns (vertical) and rows (horizontal). The former is called "Attributes", and the latter is called "Records".
- Tables can have relationships with each other.
- Queries and operations in relational databases are performed using "SQL (Structured Query Language)".
- Also known as "General Purpose Databases", they are currently the most widely used databases for building systems and applications.
- Mainstream relational databases in the market included:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Cloud-based relational databases include:
    - Amazon Aurora
    - Google Cloud Spanner
    - Azure SQL DB

Due to rapid development and increasingly complex applications, building and maintaining large and complex databases can be resource-intensive and costly. This has led to the emergence of alternative database types, known as "Non-relational Databases".

### Non-relational Databases (NoSQL Databases)

NoSQL databases include:
- Key-Value Databases
- In-memory Databases
- Graph Databases
- Columnar Databases
- Document Databases

#### Key-Value Databases

- Use a collection of key-value pairs, with keys serving as unique identifiers. The data type of the value can vary.
- Each piece of data is independent, allowing for high distribution and horizontal scaling.
- No need to perform any table relationships.
- Common examples include: Google Big Table, Amazon Dynamo, etc.  

#### In-memory Databases
- Create distributed databases using memory to speed up data retrieval.
- Suitable for applications requiring fast access, such as website caching, gaming, and banking transactions.
- Common examples include: Redis, Memcached, etc.

#### Document Databases
- Store data in documents, typically in JSON or BSON format.
- Each document can have a different structure, allowing for flexibility in data storage.
- Document databases are often used for applications that require complex data structures.
- Common examples include: MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.

#### Columnar Databases
- Store data in columns rather than rows, making them suitable for handling large-scale data analysis and queries.
- This type of database is often used in big data analytics and machine learning applications.
- Common examples include: Snowflake, MariaDB, BigQuery, etc.   

#### Graph Databases
- Specifically designed to store data in a graph structure, representing relationships between nodes.
- This type of database is highly scalable and is suitable for complex relationships.
- Common examples include: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, etc.
