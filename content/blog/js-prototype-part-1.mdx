In [last article](/blog/js-prototype-introduction-programming-paradigms), we talked about the programming paradigms, and a bit about JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language, and how it supports multiple paradigms.
Today, let's dive deeper into JavaScript Prototype.

## What is Prototype in JavaScript?

Before we jump into JavaScript prototype, you may heard of that all data types in JavaScript are objects,but there're a significant difference between primitive types and objects.

### Primitive types

Primitive types are immutable, and they are **passed by value**, the primitive types in JavaScript are:

1. number
2. string
3. boolean
4. null
5. undefined
6. symbol
7. bigint

but why we can use methods like `toUpperCase()` on a string, or `toFixed()` on a number? This is because javascript will automatically wrap the primitive type with an object when you call a method on it, this is called **boxing**.
For example:

```js
let str = "hello";
console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // HELLO
```

Under the hood, JS will do something like this, same goes for number, boolean, etc.

```js
let str = "hello";
let strObj = new String(str);
console.log(strObj.toUpperCase()); // HELLO

// same for number
let num = 123;
let numObj = new Number(num);
console.log(numObj.toFixed(2)); // 123.00
```

### Objects types

Objects are mutable, and they are **passed by reference**, objects in JavaScript are:

1. function
2. array
3. object
4. Date

#### Constructor Function

A constructor function is a special function that will create an object via the `new` keyword, and the convention is to start the function name with a capital letter, for example:

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// person1 is an instance of Person
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
```
