In [last article](/blog/js-prototype-part-1), we talked about the basic of JavaScript Prototype, and how it works, today, let's dive deeper into JavaScript Prototype chain.

## Prototype chain

Like we've mentioned before, JavaScript is a prototype-based language, although it has a **class** syntax, but it's just a syntax sugar, under the hood,
it still uses prototype

In JavaScript, it uses **objects** to implement inheritance, each of objects has a link to a object called **prototype**, and this prototype object also has a prototype object and it goes to the end of the chain which is `null`.

### Possible to mutate members of the prototype chain or swap the prototype object?

Yes, it's possible, let's see example below:

```typescript
function Cat() {}
Cat.prototype.sound = function () {
  return "Meow";
};

const oldCat = new Cat();

// 替換整個原型
Cat.prototype = {
  sound: function () {
    return "woof";
  },
  run: function () {
    return "running";
  },
};

const newCat = new Cat();

console.log(oldCat.sound()); // Meow
console.log(newCat.sound()); // woof
console.log(oldCat.run); // undefined
console.log(newCat.run()); // running
```

Let's break down the code above:

- Declared a `Cat` function (constructor) and added a `sound` method to its prototype.
