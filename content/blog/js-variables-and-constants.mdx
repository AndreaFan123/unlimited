## What is a variable?

A variable is a storage location that can hold a value. It can be changed during the execution.

In JavaScript, we can declare a variable using var, let, or const. In modern JavaScript, using let and const to declare a variable is the preferred option.

```js
var age = 23;
age = 24;

let height = 1.59;
height = 1.62;
```

## What is a constants?

Like a variable, but the value cannot be changed once it is assigned.

```js
const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.14159; // This will throw an error
```

### Key Differences:

- Mutability
  - Variables: Value can be changed after they’re initialized.
  - Constants: Value cannot be changed once they’re initialized.
- Declaration:
  - Use let to declare a variable.
  - Use const to declare a constant.

### Scoped

#### Let and Const Declarations

> let and const declarations define variables that are scoped to the running execution context's LexicalEnvironment.

#### Variable Statement

> A var statement declares variables that are scoped to the running execution context's VariableEnvironment.

### LexicalEnvironment

- A specification type that defines the accessibility of variables and functions within a specific code execution context.
  Handle **block-scoped** variables (e.g., those declared with **let** and **const**).
- A new **LexicalEnvironment** is created each time a new scope is entered (e.g., function calls, block statements, etc.).
  So…what is a **block-scoped** means? A **block-scoped** refers to the scope created by block statements (e.g., those within curly braces). Variables declared with **let** and **const** within these blocks are only accessible within the block.

```js
// Block-scoped
function greeting() {
  ...
};

if(true) {
...
} else {
...
};

for(...) {
...
}
```

### VariableEnvironment

- Similar to LexicalEnvironment in that it also comprises an environment record and an outer environment reference.
- Manage variable declarations within function scope and global scope (e.g., variables declared with var).
- When a function or global execution context is created, the VariableEnvironment stores variables declared with var.

### Key differences between LexicalEnvironment and VariableEnvironment

- Scope Type:
  - **LexicalEnvironment** handles variables declared with let, const, and class as well as function declarations.
  - **VariableEnvironment** handles variables declared with var.
- Creation of Environment Records:
  - In block scopes (e.g., if or for blocks), only a new LexicalEnvironment is created, not a new VariableEnvironment.
- Scope Range:
  - LexicalEnvironment has block scope characteristics.
  - VariableEnvironment has function scope characteristics (only within the function execution context).

### Let’s practice and review the concepts that we’ve mentioned in this article.

```js
function testScope() {
  var a = 1;
  let b = 2;
  const c = 3;

  if (true) {
    var a = 4;
    let b = 5;
    const c = 6;
    console.log(a); // ?
    console.log(b); // ?
    console.log(c); // ?
  }

  console.log(a); // ?
  console.log(b); // ?
  console.log(c); // ?
}

testScope();
```

### Answer

```js
function testScope() {
  var a = 1;
  let b = 2;
  const c = 3;

  if (true) {
    var a = 4;
    let b = 5;
    const c = 6;
    console.log(a); // 4
    console.log(b); // 5
    console.log(c); // 6
  }

  console.log(a); // 4
  console.log(b); // 2
  console.log(c); // 3
}

testScope();
```

### Explanation

Inside this **testScope** function, variable a has been modified from **1** to **4** inside the if statement. That's why when we **console.log(a)**, the answer was **4** instead of **1**, because **a** was managed by the **VariableEnvironment** and it lived in the whole function scope.

Think of when we use var to declare a variable, it has the access to enter every room **(function scope and block scope)**.

On the other hand, using **let** and **const** to declare variables means they are managed by the **LexicalEnvironment**. We can think of this as having two rooms: the first set of **b** and **c** lives in the room of the function scope, and the second set of **b** and **c** lives in the room of the if statement **(block scope)**.

Therefore, when we **console.log(b)** and **console.log(c)** within the if block, the values were **5** and **6**, because it could only access the values within the if statement. When we try to **console.log(b)** and **console.log(c)** outside of the if statement, it can access the values within the function scope but cannot access the values that lived inside the if statement.
