Two years ago, I was a marketer, working in a fintech company with a good salary and stable, flexible working hours. I've never thought about being a programmer, because for me, coding is something that people who are good at math do, and I'm not really good at math, but it turns out that I'm partially wrong, in this article, I'd like to share my journey and my thoughts.

## The way of thinking
I like to observe, I like to listen to people, this is how I understand the person in front of me and the environment around me. I used to think out of the box because of my personality and my job needs, the way I used to think is like this:

1. We can do something differently.
2. Then start thinking about how to do it.
3. If it's not possible, then forget it.
